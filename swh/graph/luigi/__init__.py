Luigi tasks
===========

This package contains `Luigi <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/>`_ tasks.
These come in two kinds:

* in :mod:`swh.graph.luigi.compressed_graph`: an alternative to the 'swh graph compress'
  CLI that can be composed with other tasks, such as swh-dataset's
* in other submodules: tasks driving the creation of specific datasets that are
  generated using the compressed graph


The overall directory structure is::

    base_dir/
        <date>[_<flavor>]/
            edges/
                ...
            orc/
                ...
            compressed/
                graph.graph
                graph.mph
                ...
                meta/
                    export.json
                    compression.json
            datasets/
                contribution_graph.csv.zst
            topology/
                topological_order_dfs.csv.zst

And optionally::

    sensitive_base_dir/
        <date>[_<flavor>]/
            persons_sha256_to_name.csv.zst
            datasets/
                contribution_graph.deanonymized.csv.zst
