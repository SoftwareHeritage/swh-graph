luigi != 3.5.2, < 3.7.0 # 3.5.2 is buggy: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3312 . 3.7.0 to 3.7.2 are buggy: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3376 and https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3382 . And we can't make mypy pass for both <3.7.0 and >= 3.7.3, and 3.7.x does not support Python 3.13 (https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3390) so we stick to <3.7.0 for now.
