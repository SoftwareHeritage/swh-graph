.. _swh-graph-example-dataset:

Example dataset
===============

:mod:`swh.graph.example_dataset` contains a synthetic dataset made of only a
very tiny number of objects.  Any real-world input for the Software Heritage
software stack is likely to be orders of magnitude bigger. However, it is small
enough to be easily comprehensive for human beings. This makes it useful for
exploring the behavior of ``swh.graph`` or  writing tests.

.. warning::
   Except for origins, :ref:`SWHIDs` for these objects are synthetic and
   incorrect: they are arbitrary instead of having been computed from
   the content of the objects. While these are easier to comprehend for
   human brains, this quirk might introduce discrepancies or assertion errors
   whenever the value of the object :ref:`SWHIDs` is checked against their data.

Using the dataset
-----------------

Running a local server using this dataset can be done with:

.. code:: console

   $ swh graph rpc-serve -g swh/graph/example_dataset/compressed/example &
   $ curl http://localhost:5009/graph/leaves/swh:1:dir:0000000000000000000000000000000000000002
   swh:1:cnt:0000000000000000000000000000000000000001


.. _regenerate_swh-graph_example_dataset:

Regenerating the dataset
------------------------

The package already contains files suitable for consumption by ``swh.graph``
made from this dataset. If needed, they can be regenerated by running:

.. code:: console

   $ python -m swh.graph.example_dataset.generate_dataset \\
         --compress \\
         swh/graph/example_dataset

The ``--compress`` optionally performs a graph compression step.

.. warning::

   While semantically equivalent, the graph compression output is not reproducible
   from a run to the next. Creating a new compressed graph would require to update many
   constants in the ``swh.graph`` test suite given the current implementation.

Content
-------

The example dataset mostly mimics the development of a tiny project. It has
been released once, and then its development has been picked up in a fork.
